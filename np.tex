\subsubsection{NP-Hardness}
It is well known that finding $k$-element set that maximizes monotone and submodular function in NP hard, with an easy reduction to MAX-COVER, but as mentioned before simple greedy algorithm obtains $(1-\frac{1}{e})$ approximation. \cite{nemhauser1978analysis}. This approximation is also tight \cite{feige1998threshold}.
NP-Hardness proofs for the independent cascading model and linear threshold model were already presented in 
Kempe et al. work \cite{kempe2003maximizing}. 

In general, the adaptive seeding model is more complex then the calssic influence maximization problem, since every influence maximization problem can be simulated by the adaptive seeding model, if $S=V$.
