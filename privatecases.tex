\section{private cases}
\subsection{private cases - simpler approaches from paper 1}

Given a network $G=(V,E)$, an influence function $f:2^{V}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}_{+}$we
define the following function $F_{H,t}:2^{X}\rightarrow R_{+}$, for
a subgraph $H$ and parameter $t\in\mathbb{N}$ as: $F_{H,t}(S):=\max_{T\subseteq N(S):|T|\leq k}f(S\cup T)$. 

If $F_{H,t}(\cdot)$ is monotone submodular for all $t\leq k$ and
all graphs $H$, Sample Average Approximation (SAA) is a simple technique
which obtains an approximately $(1-1/e)$-approximation. The adaptive
seeding two stage problem can be formulated as the following optimization
problem: $\max\left\{ \sum_{H\in G}p_{H}F_{H,t}(S):S\subseteq X,|S|+y\leq k\right\} $.$\mathcal{G}$
is the set of all possible realizations and $p_{H}$ is the probability
of the bipartite graph $H=(X\cup R,E_{X,R})$ to realize where $R\subseteq N(X)$,
$E_{X,R}$ being the set of edges between $X$ and $R$ in the network
$G=(V,E)$. $F_{t}(S)=\sum_{H\in G}p_{H}F_{H,t}(S)$ is a monotone
submodular function since it is a weighted sum of monotone submodular
functions for any $t\leq k-1$. $F_{t}(S)$ can be approximated by
sampling polynomially many graphs (as demonstrated in the triggering
model chapter of this survey), and the greedy algorithm for submodular
maximization by Nemhauser can be used to obtain a $(1-1/e-\epsilon)$-approximation
for any $\epsilon>0$. By repeating this procedure for every $t\in\{0,\ldots,k-1\}$
and returning the solution $S\subseteq X$ with the maximal value,
a $(1-1/e-\epsilon)$-approximation for the two stage problem can
be obtained.

In {[}Singer and Seeman 2013{]} two special cases of influence functions
for which $F_{H,t}(\cdot)$ is monotone submodular are discussed.
The first is \textbf{additive functions}. A function is additive when
$f(S)=\sum_{i\in S}w_{i}$ for some fixed $w_{i},i\in[n]$. The well
studied Voter model {[}34{]}, for example, is an additive influence
function {[}19{]}. For such functions $F_{H,t}(\cdot)$ as defined
above is monotone submodular. 

The second case mentioned in {[}Singer and Seeman 2013{]} is \textbf{symmetric
submodular functions}. A function is symmetric submodular when $f(T)=\sum_{i\leq T}r_{i}$
where $r_{i}\in\mathbb{R}_{+}$ is some fixed set that respects $r_{1}\geq r_{2}\geq\ldots\geq r_{n}$,
in which case the function $F_{H,t}(\cdot)$ is submodular. The proofs
that additive functions and symmetric submodular functions are submodular
are specified in the full version of the paper {[}Singer and Seeman
2013{]}.
